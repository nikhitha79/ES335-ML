- Wavelet energy_2 (Feature 358) appears in the top 10 for both models, but at 1st position (higest importance) in Random Forest and in 10th position in LR. Also importance value for the feature is different for both models.

- Wavelet energy_8 (feature 364) also appears in the top 10 for both models, but at 5th position in Random Forest and in 8th position in LR. Also importance value for the feature is different for both models.

- Both models have a lot of peaks between Feature 358 to Feature 374. This consistency suggests that these features might have a significant impact on the target variable regardless of the modeling technique used.

- Despite some overlaps, there are noticeable differences in the rankings of features between the two models. This indicates that the models might be weighing certain features differently in their predictions.
